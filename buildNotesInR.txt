This is my current attempt at a minimalist set of tools to build fftwtools R package on various platforms. FFTW must be installed on the platforms for this to work.

I test this by building the package on LINUX with the latest development version of R and I check the package --as-cran prior to uploading to CRAN. When I change build scripts that may affect how the packages link external libraries such as BLAS, LAPACK, or FFTW, I test the build on winbuilder, an NT machine matained by Uwe Liggs. http://win-builder.r-project.org/

configure.ac ## required on LINUX 
configure ## I wonder if this can be removed? (Removed success May 4 2013)
src/Makevars.in ## required on LINUX
src/Makevars ## required for Windows, on Uwe's machine
src/build/autoconf/install.sh ## required on LINUX
src/build/autoconf/config.guess ## perhaps these last two can be removed (Removed success May 4 2013)
src/build/autoconf/config.sub (Removed success May 4 2013)

Note this differs from the multitaper package which requires the following files: 
configure.ac
src/Makevars
src/Makevars.in
src/makevars.win

This is due to how I set up configure script in fftwtools which requires an external package. In the case of the multitaper package, BLAS and LAPACK (in 64bit versions) are included in R.
