This appears to be the minimialist list to build fftwtools R package on various platforms. FFTW must be installed on the platforms for this to work

configure.ac
configure ## removing causes issues
src/Makevars.in
src/build/autoconf/install.sh

Note this differs from the multitaper package which requires the following files: 
src/Makevars
src/Makevars.in
src/makevars.win
This is due to how I set up configure script in fftwtools which requires an external package. In the case of the multtitaper package, BLAS and LAPACK (in 64bit versions) are included in R.
